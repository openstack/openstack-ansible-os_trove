    Added SSH keypair generation support to the Trove Guest Agent.
    When ``trove_guest_ssh_enabled`` is set to ``True``, the role
    generates an SSH keypair and uploads it to Nova. It also creates
    a security group that permits SSH access on the DBaaS network and
    appends it to ``management_security_groups``.
