    Implemented SSH keypair generation for Trove Guest Agent. When
    ``trove_guest_ssh_enabled`` is set to True, role will perform SSH
    keypair generation and upload to Nova. With that, a security group
    will be created and added to the ``management_security_groups``
    which will allow SSH traffic on dbaas network.
